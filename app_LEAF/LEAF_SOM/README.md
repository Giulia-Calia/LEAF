# LEAF-Self Organizing Map-Shiny
In this shiny app you can have a more detailed overview of the putative effectors predicted by LEAF at a feature-by-feature scale.
In the last tab of the app it is possible to retrieve information on proteins belonging to one or more cell on the map.

## Usage
Command line 
```
R -e "shiny::runApp('./app_LEAF/LEAF_SOM')"
```
The app will directly read as input the files contained in ./app_LEAF/tables directory
